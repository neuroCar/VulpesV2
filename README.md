# Vulpes
A Discord bot made with Discord.js.

## Instructions to Run Vulpes
- Install dependencies with NodeJS using `npm install`
- Copy config.example.json to config.json to avoid exposing your token & client ID, then replace your token and client ID with the values from your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Start the bot with `npm start`, which will automatically register commands and restart on changes for you

Now you have your very own Vulpes!
